# Installing Optimus-IDE-Collab

A single CLI (`optimus-ide-collab`) is used for both the Optimus-IDE-Collab server and the client.

We support two release channels: mainline and stable - read the
[Releases](./releases/index.md) page to learn more about which best suits your team.

## Linux/macOS

Our install script is the fastest way to install Optimus-IDE-Collab on Linux/macOS:

```sh
curl -L https://optimus-ide-collab.com/install.sh | sh
```

Refer to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/optimus-ide-collab/optimus-ide-collab/releases) for
alternate installation methods (e.g. standalone binaries, system packages).

## Windows

If you plan to use the built-in PostgreSQL database, ensure that the
[Visual C++ Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)
is installed.

Use [GitHub releases](https://github.com/optimus-ide-collab/optimus-ide-collab/releases) to download the
Windows installer (`.msi`) or standalone binary (`.exe`).

Alternatively, you can use the
[`winget`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#use-winget)
package manager to install Optimus-IDE-Collab:

```ps1
winget install Optimus-IDE-Collab.Optimus-IDE-Collab
```

To start the Optimus-IDE-Collab server:

```sh
optimus-ide-collab server
```

![Optimus-IDE-Collab install](../images/screenshots/welcome-create-admin-user.png)

To log in to an existing Optimus-IDE-Collab deployment:

```sh
optimus-ide-collab login https://optimus-ide-collab.example.com
```

## Download the CLI from your deployment

> [!NOTE]
> Available in Optimus-IDE-Collab 2.19 and newer on macOS and Linux clients only.

Every Optimus-IDE-Collab server hosts CLI binaries for all supported platforms. You can run a
script to download the appropriate CLI for your machine from your Optimus-IDE-Collab
deployment.

![Install Optimus-IDE-Collab binary from your deployment](../images/install/install_from_deployment.png)

This script works within air-gapped deployments and ensures that the version of
the CLI you have installed on your machine matches the version of the server.

This script can be useful when authoring a template for installing the CLI.
