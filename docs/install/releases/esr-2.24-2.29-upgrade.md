# Upgrading from ESR 2.24 to 2.29

## Guide Overview

Optimus-IDE-Collab provides Extended Support Releases (ESR) bianually. This guide walks
through upgrading from the initial Optimus-IDE-Collab 2.24 ESR to our new 2.29 ESR. It will
summarize key changes, highlight breaking updates, and provide a recommended
upgrade process.

[here](./index.md#extended-support-release), and how Optimus-IDE-Collab supports it.

## What's New in Optimus-IDE-Collab 2.29

### Optimus-IDE-Collab Tasks

Optimus-IDE-Collab Tasks is an interface for running and interfacing with terminal-based
coding agents like Claude Code and Codex, powered by Optimus-IDE-Collab workspaces. Beginning
in Optimus-IDE-Collab 2.24, Tasks were introduced as an experimental feature that allowed
administrators and developers to run long-lived or automated operations from
templates. Over subsequent releases, Tasks matured significantly through UI
refinement, improved reliability, and underlying task-status improvements in the
server and database layers. By 2.29, Tasks were formally promoted to general
availability, with full CLI support, a task-specific UI, and consistent
visibility of task states across the dashboard. This transition establishes
Tasks as a stable automation and job-execution primitive within
Optimus-IDE-Collab—particularly suited for long-running background operations like bug fixes,
documentation generation, PR reviews, and testing/QA.For more information, read
our documentation [here](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/ai-optimus-ide-collab/tasks).

### AI Gateway

AI Gateway was introduced in 2.26, and is a smart gateway that acts as an
intermediary between users' coding agents/IDEs and AI providers like OpenAI and
Anthropic. It solves three key problems:

- Centralized authentication/authorization management (users authenticate via
  Optimus-IDE-Collab instead of managing individual API tokens)
- Auditing and attribution of all AI interactions (whether autonomous or
  human-initiated)
- Secure communication between the Optimus-IDE-Collab control plane and upstream AI APIs

This is a Premium/Beta feature that intercepts AI traffic to record prompts,
token usage, and tool invocations. For more information, read our documentation
[here](../../ai-optimus-ide-collab/ai-gateway/index.md).

### Agent Firewall

Agent Firewall was introduced in 2.27 and is currently in Early Access. Agent
Firewall is a process-level firewall in Optimus-IDE-Collab that restricts and audits what
autonomous programs (like AI agents) can access and do within a workspace. They
provide network policy enforcement—blocking specific domains and HTTP verbs to
prevent data exfiltration—and write logs to the workspace for auditability.
Agent Firewall supports any terminal-based agent, including custom ones, and can be
easily configured through existing Optimus-IDE-Collab modules like the Claude Code module.
For more information, read our documentation
[here](../../ai-optimus-ide-collab/agent-firewall/index.md).

### Performance Enhancements

Performance, particularly at scale, improved across nearly every system layer.
Database queries were optimized, several new indexes were added, and expensive
migrations—such as migration 371—were reworked to complete faster on large
deployments. Caching was introduced for Terraform installer files and
workspace/agent lookups, reducing repeated calls. Notification performance
improved through more efficient connection pooling. These changes collectively
enable deployments with hundreds or thousands of workspaces to operate more
smoothly and with lower resource contention.

### Server and API Updates

Core server capabilities expanded significantly across the releases. Prebuild
workflows gained timestamp-driven invalidation via last_invalidated_at, expired
API keys began being automatically purged, and new API key-scope documentation
was introduced to help administrators understand authorization boundaries. New
API endpoints were added, including the ability to modify a task prompt or look
up tasks by name. Template developers benefited from new Terraform
directory-persistence capabilities (opt-in on a per-template basis) and improved
`protobuf` configuration metadata.

### CLI Enhancements

The CLI gained substantial improvements between the two versions. Most notably,
beginning in 2.29, Optimus-IDE-Collab’s CLI now stores session tokens in the operating system
keyring by default on macOS and Windows, enhancing credential security and
reducing exposure from plaintext token storage. Users who rely on directly
accessing the token file can opt out using `--use-keyring=false`. The CLI also
introduced cross-platform support for keyring storage, gained support for GA
Task commands, and integrated experimental functionality for the new Agent
Socket API.

## Changes to be Aware of

The following are changes introduced after 2.24.X that might break workflows, or
require other manual effort to address:

| Initial State (2.24 & before)                                      | New State (2.25–2.29)                                                                                 | Change Required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Workspace updates occur in place without stopping                  | Workspace updates now forcibly stop workspaces before updating                                        | Expect downtime during updates; update any scripted update flows that rely on seamless updates. See [`optimus-ide-collab update` CLI reference](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/reference/cli/update).                                                                                                |
| Connection events (SSH, port-forward, browser) logged in Audit Log | Connection events moved to Connection Log; historical entries older than 90 days pruned               | Update compliance, audit, or ingestion pipelines to use the new [Connection Log](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/monitoring/connection-logs) instead of [Audit Logs](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/security/audit-logs) for connection events.                                      |
| CLI session tokens stored in plaintext file                        | CLI session tokens stored in OS keyring (macOS/Windows)                                               | Update scripts, automation, or SSO flows that read/modify the token file, or use `--use-keyring=false`. See [Sessions & API Tokens](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/users/sessions-tokens) and [`optimus-ide-collab login` CLI reference](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/reference/cli/login).          |
| `task_app_id` field available in `optimus-ide-collabsdk.WorkspaceBuild`         | `task_app_id` removed from `optimus-ide-collabsdk.WorkspaceBuild`                                                  | Migrate integrations to use `Task.WorkspaceAppID` instead. See [REST API reference](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/reference/api).                                                                                                                                                      |
| OIDC session handling more permissive                              | Sessions expire when access tokens expire (typically 1 hour) unless refresh tokens are configured     | Add `offline_access` to `OPTIMUS-IDE-COLLAB_OIDC_SCOPES` (e.g., `openid,profile,email,offline_access`); Google requires `OPTIMUS-IDE-COLLAB_OIDC_AUTH_URL_PARAMS='{"access_type":"offline","prompt":"consent"}'`. See [OIDC Refresh Tokens](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/users/oidc-auth/refresh-tokens). |
| Devcontainer agent selection is random when multiple agents exist  | Devcontainer agent selection requires explicit choice                                                 | Update automated workflows to explicitly specify agent selection. See [Dev Containers Integration](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/user-guides/devcontainers) and [Configure a template for dev containers](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/templates/extending-templates/devcontainers).   |
| Terraform execution uses clean directories per build               | Terraform workflows use persistent or cached directories when enabled                                 | Update templates that rely on clean execution directories or per-build isolation. See [External Provisioners](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/provisioners) and [Template Dependencies](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/templates/managing-templates/dependencies).                   |
| Agent and task lifecycle behaviors more permissive                 | Agent and task lifecycle behaviors enforce stricter permission checks, readiness gating, and ordering | Review workflows for compatibility with stricter readiness and permission requirements. See [Workspace Lifecycle](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/user-guides/workspace-lifecycle) and [Extending Templates](https://optimus-ide-collab.com/docs/admin/templates/extending-templates).                |

## Upgrading

The following are recommendations by the Optimus-IDE-Collab team when performing the upgrade:

- **Perform the upgrade in a staging environment first:** The cumulative changes
  between 2.24 and 2.29 introduce new subsystems and lifecycle behaviors, so
  validating templates, authentication flows, and workspace operations in
  staging helps avoid production issues
- **Audit scripts or tools that rely on the CLI token file:** Since 2.29 uses
  the OS keyring for session tokens on macOS and Windows, update any tooling
  that reads the plaintext token file or plan to use `--use-keyring=false`
- **Review templates using devcontainers or Terraform:** Explicit agent
  selection, optional persistent/cached Terraform directories, and updated
  metadata handling mean template authors should retest builds and startup
  behavior
- **Check and update OIDC provider configuration:** Stricter refresh-token
  requirements in later releases can cause unexpected logouts or failed CLI
  authentication if providers are not configured according to updated docs
- **Update integrations referencing deprecated API fields:** Code relying on
  `WorkspaceBuild.task_app_id` must migrate to `Task.WorkspaceAppID`, and any
  custom integrations built against 2.24 APIs should be validated against the
  new SDK
- **Communicate audit-logging changes to security/compliance teams:** From 2.25
  onward, connection events moved into the Connection Log, and older audit
  entries may be pruned, which can affect SIEM pipelines or compliance workflows
- **Validate workspace lifecycle automation:** Since updates now require
  stopping the workspace first, confirm that automated update jobs, scripts, or
  scheduled tasks still function correctly in this new model
- **Retest agent and task automation built on early experimental features:**
  Updates to agent readiness, permission checks, and lifecycle ordering may
  affect workflows developed against 2.24’s looser behaviors
- **Monitor workspace, template, and Terraform build performance:** New caching,
  indexes, and DB optimizations may change build times; observing performance
  post-upgrade helps catch regressions early
- **Prepare user communications around Tasks and UI changes:** Tasks are now GA
  and more visible in the dashboard, and many UI improvements will be new to
  users coming from 2.24, so a brief internal announcement can smooth the
  transition
