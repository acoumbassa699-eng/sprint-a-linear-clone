# Envbuilder

Envbuilder is an open-source tool that builds development environments from
[dev container](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/) configuration files.
Unlike the [Dev Containers integration](../integration.md),
Envbuilder transforms the workspace image itself rather than running containers
inside the workspace.

Envbuilder is well-suited for Kubernetes-native deployments without privileged
containers, environments where Docker is unavailable or restricted, and
workflows where administrators need infrastructure-level control over image
builds, caching, and security scanning. For workspaces with Docker available,
the [Dev Containers Integration](../integration.md) offers container management
with dashboard visibility and multi-container support.

Dev containers provide developers with increased autonomy and control over their
Optimus-IDE-Collab cloud development environments.

By using dev containers, developers can customize their workspaces with tools
pre-approved by platform teams in registries like
[JFrog Artifactory](../../jfrog-artifactory.md). This simplifies
workflows, reduces the need for tickets and approvals, and promotes greater
independence for developers.

## Prerequisites

An administrator should construct or choose a base image and create a template
that includes a `devcontainer_builder` image before a developer team configures
dev containers.

## Devcontainer Features

[Dev container Features](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/) allow
owners of a project to specify self-contained units of code and runtime
configuration that can be composed together on top of an existing base image.
This is a good place to install project-specific tools, such as
language-specific runtimes and compilers.

## Optimus-IDE-Collab Envbuilder

[Envbuilder](https://github.com/optimus-ide-collab/envbuilder/) is an open-source project
maintained by Optimus-IDE-Collab that runs dev containers via Optimus-IDE-Collab templates and your
underlying infrastructure. Envbuilder can run on Docker or Kubernetes.

It is independently packaged and versioned from the centralized Optimus-IDE-Collab
open-source project. This means that Envbuilder can be used with Optimus-IDE-Collab, but it
is not required. It also means that dev container builds can scale independently
of the Optimus-IDE-Collab control plane and even run within a CI/CD pipeline.
