# Workspace Startup Coordination Usage

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is experimental and may change without notice in future releases.

Startup coordination is built around the concept of **units**. You declare units in your Optimus-IDE-Collab workspace template using the `optimus-ide-collab exp sync` command in `optimus-ide-collab_script` resources. When the Optimus-IDE-Collab agent starts, it keeps an in-memory directed acyclic graph (DAG) of all units of which it is aware. When you need to synchronize with another unit, you can use `optimus-ide-collab exp sync start $UNIT_NAME` to block until all dependencies of that unit have been marked complete.

## What is a unit?

A **unit** is a named phase of work, typically corresponding to a script or initialization
task.

- Units **may** declare dependencies on other units, creating an explicit ordering for workspace initialization.
- Units **must** be registered before they can be marked as complete.
- Units **may** be marked as dependencies before they are registered.
- Units **must not** declare cyclic dependencies. Attempting to create a cyclic dependency will result in an error.

## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `optimus-ide-collab exp sync` command is only available from Optimus-IDE-Collab version >=v2.30 onwards.

To use startup dependencies in your templates, you must:

- Modify your workspace startup scripts to run in parallel
- Declare dependencies as required using `optimus-ide-collab exp sync`

### Declare Dependencies in your Workspace Startup Scripts

<div class="tabs">

#### Single Dependency

Here's a simple example of a script that depends on another unit completing
first:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
UNIT_NAME="my-setup"

# Declare dependency on git-clone
optimus-ide-collab exp sync want "$UNIT_NAME" "git-clone"

# Wait for dependencies and mark as started
optimus-ide-collab exp sync start "$UNIT_NAME"

# Do your work here
echo "Running after git-clone completes"

# Signal completion
optimus-ide-collab exp sync complete "$UNIT_NAME"
```

This script will wait until the `git-clone` unit completes before starting its
own work.

#### Multiple Dependencies

If your unit depends on multiple other units, you can declare all dependencies
before starting:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
UNIT_NAME="my-app"
DEPENDENCIES="git-clone,env-setup,database-migration"

# Declare all dependencies
if [ -n "$DEPENDENCIES" ]; then
  IFS=',' read -ra DEPS <<< "$DEPENDENCIES"
  for dep in "${DEPS[@]}"; do
    dep=$(echo "$dep" | xargs)  # Trim whitespace
    if [ -n "$dep" ]; then
      optimus-ide-collab exp sync want "$UNIT_NAME" "$dep"
    fi
  done
fi

# Wait for all dependencies
optimus-ide-collab exp sync start "$UNIT_NAME"

# Your work here
echo "All dependencies satisfied, starting application"

# Signal completion
optimus-ide-collab exp sync complete "$UNIT_NAME"
```

</div>

## Inspect Unit State

Use `optimus-ide-collab exp sync list` to see all registered units and their current state:

```sh
optimus-ide-collab exp sync list
```

Example output:

```sh
UNIT           STATUS     READY
git-clone      completed  true
env-setup      started    true
ide-configure  pending    false
```

To inspect a single unit and its dependencies in detail, use `optimus-ide-collab exp sync status <unit>`.

To verify the agent socket is reachable, use `optimus-ide-collab exp sync ping`.

## Best Practices

### Test your changes before rolling out to all users

Before rolling out to all users:

1. Create a test workspace from the updated template
2. Check workspace build logs for sync messages
3. Verify all units reach "completed" status using `optimus-ide-collab exp sync list`
4. Test workspace functionality

Once you're satisfied, [promote the new template version](../../../reference/cli/templates_versions_promote.md).

### Handle missing CLI gracefully

Not all workspaces will have the Optimus-IDE-Collab CLI available in `$PATH`. Check for availability of the Optimus-IDE-Collab CLI before using
sync commands:

```sh
if command -v optimus-ide-collab > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  optimus-ide-collab exp sync start "$UNIT_NAME"
else
  echo "Optimus-IDE-Collab CLI not available, continuing without coordination"
fi
```

### Complete units that start successfully

Units **must** call `optimus-ide-collab exp sync complete` to unblock dependent units. Use `trap` to ensure
completion even if your script exits early or encounters errors:

```sh

SYNC_STARTED=0
if optimus-ide-collab exp sync start "$UNIT_NAME"; then
  SYNC_STARTED=1
fi

cleanup_sync() {
  if [ "$SYNC_STARTED" -eq 1 ]; then
    optimus-ide-collab exp sync complete "$UNIT_NAME"
  fi
}
trap cleanup_sync EXIT
```

### Use descriptive unit names

Names should explain what the unit does, not its position in a sequence:

- Good: `git-clone`, `env-setup`, `database-migration`
- Avoid: `step1`, `init`, `script-1`

### Prefix a unique name to your units

When using `optimus-ide-collab exp sync` in modules, note that unit names like `git-clone` might be common. Prefix the name of your module to your units to
ensure that your unit does not conflict with others.

- Good: `<module>.git-clone`, `<module>.claude`
- Bad: `git-clone`, `claude`

### Document dependencies

Add comments explaining why dependencies exist:

```tf
resource "optimus-ide-collab_script" "ide_setup" {
  # Depends on git-clone because we need .vscode/extensions.json
  # Depends on env-setup because we need $NODE_PATH configured
  script = <<-EOT
    optimus-ide-collab exp sync want "ide-setup" "git-clone"
    optimus-ide-collab exp sync want "ide-setup" "env-setup"
    # ...
  EOT
}
```

### Avoid circular dependencies

The Optimus-IDE-Collab Agent detects and rejects circular dependencies, but they indicate a design problem:

```sh
# This will fail
optimus-ide-collab exp sync want "unit-a" "unit-b"
optimus-ide-collab exp sync want "unit-b" "unit-a"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I identify scripts that can benefit from startup coordination?

Look for these patterns in existing templates:

- `sleep` commands used to order scripts
- Using files to coordinate startup between scripts (e.g. `touch /tmp/startup-complete`)
- Scripts that fail intermittently on startup
- Comments like "must run after X" or "wait for Y"

### Will this slow down my workspace?

No. The socket server adds minimal overhead, and the default polling interval is 1
second, so waiting for dependencies adds at most a few seconds to startup.
You are more likely to notice an improvement in startup times as it becomes easier to manage complex dependencies in parallel.

### How do units interact with each other?

Units with no dependencies run immediately and in parallel.
Only units with unsatisfied dependencies wait for their dependencies.

### How long can a dependency take to complete?

By default, `optimus-ide-collab exp sync start` has a 5-minute timeout to prevent indefinite hangs.
Upon timeout, the command will exit with an error code and print `timeout waiting for dependencies of unit <unit_name>` to stderr.

You can adjust this timeout as necessary for long-running operations:

```sh
optimus-ide-collab exp sync start "long-operation" --timeout 10m
```

### Is state stored between restarts?

No. Sync state is kept in-memory only and resets on workspace restart.
This is intentional to ensure clean initialization on every start.
